# Template Samples Folder

This folder stores original sample documents (PDF, Word) that are used to generate custom HTML templates.

## Purpose
- User uploads sample documents that represent their firm's formatting standards
- Agent analyzes these samples using Gemini CLI
- Generated HTML templates are saved to `templates/html/`

## Workflow
1. User uploads samples via the Upload Template Samples modal
2. Files are saved here as `[document-type]-sample.[ext]`
3. Agent calls Gemini CLI to analyze and generate HTML template
4. User reviews generated template in browser
5. If approved, template becomes active in `templates/html/`

See `protocols/TEMPLATE_GENERATION.md` for complete workflow.
