# Existing Infrastructure Analysis

> **Generated By:** Archaeology Phase (orchestrator.py Phase 0)
> **Purpose:** Prevent duplicate structures, identify reusable code, surface constraints

---

## 1. Existing Database Schema

### Tables Relevant to This Feature

| Table | Key Columns | Relationships | Notes |
|-------|-------------|---------------|-------|
| | | | |

### Migrations to Be Aware Of

```
- YYYY_MM_DD_create_xxx_table.php
```

### Schema Constraints

- [ ] Foreign key dependencies
- [ ] Unique constraints that affect new features
- [ ] Indexes that need extension

---

## 2. Existing API Endpoints

### Endpoints to REUSE (Do Not Duplicate)

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Location |
|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| | | | |

### Endpoints to EXTEND

| Method | Endpoint | What to Add | Why |
|--------|----------|-------------|-----|
| | | | |

### Endpoints to CREATE (Net New)

| Method | Endpoint | Purpose | Justification |
|--------|----------|---------|---------------|
| | | | |

---

## 3. Existing Models & Business Logic

### Models to REUSE

| Model | Key Methods | Location |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| | | |

### Services/Repositories to REUSE

| Service | Purpose | Location |
|---------|---------|----------|
| | | |

### Existing Validation Rules

```
// Paste existing validation that new features must respect
```

---

## 4. Existing UI Components

### Components Available for Reuse

| Component | Props | Location | Notes |
|-----------|-------|----------|-------|
| | | | |

### Existing Pages/Views to EXTEND

| View | What It Does | What to Add |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| | | |

---

## 5. Integration Points & Constraints

### External Services Already Integrated

| Service | Purpose | API/SDK Used | Existing Implementation |
|---------|---------|--------------|------------------------|
| | | | |

### Event/Queue Infrastructure

| Event | Listeners | When Triggered |
|-------|-----------|----------------|
| | | |

---

## 6. Conflict Check

### Potential Naming Conflicts

- [ ] New table names don't collide with existing
- [ ] New endpoint paths don't shadow existing routes
- [ ] New model names don't conflict

### Potential Data Conflicts

- [ ] New columns won't break existing queries
- [ ] New relationships won't orphan data
- [ ] Migration order is safe

---

## 7. Summary for Council

**REUSE:** [List what the Council should use, not recreate]

**EXTEND:** [List what needs modification, not replacement]

**CREATE:** [List what is truly net-new]

**AVOID:** [List specific things NOT to do based on existing code]

---

> ⚠️ **EXIT CONDITION:** This analysis must be complete before the Council generates any specs. The Schema Architect MUST read this file before writing `01-schema.sql`.
