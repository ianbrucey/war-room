She started making my life difficult—giving me impossible deadlines, excluding me from meetings, that sort of thing. I tried to talk to HR about it in April, but nothing changed. Then in June, they called me into a meeting and said I was being let go for 'performance issues.' But I have all my performance reviews from before Sarah arrived, and they were all excellent. I think this was retaliation for going to HR.",

I have photos from the original listing that appear to have been edited to hide the damage. The repair estimate is $45,000.",
